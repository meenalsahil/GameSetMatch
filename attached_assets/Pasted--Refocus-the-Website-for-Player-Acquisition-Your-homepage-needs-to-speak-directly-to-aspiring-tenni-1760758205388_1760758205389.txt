 Refocus the Website for Player Acquisition
Your homepage needs to speak directly to aspiring tennis players, not sponsors. The "Featured Players" section should be removed or completely repurposed for now.

1. Change the Core Messaging
Current Headline: "Empowering Tennis Players"

New Headline Idea: "Get Sponsored. Fuel Your Tennis Career." or "Your Journey to the Pro Tour Starts Here. Find Your Sponsors."

Why: This speaks directly to the player's ambition and offers a solution.

Current Sub-headline: "We connect passionate fans with promising tennis players to help them succeed."

New Sub-headline Idea: "GameSetMatch is a new platform dedicated to connecting you with a global network of fans and sponsors. Create your profile for free and get ready for our official launch."

Why: This clearly states what the platform is, who it's for (you, the player), and what the immediate action is (create a profile). It also manages expectations by mentioning a future launch.

2. Redesign the Main Call-to-Action (CTA)
Remove the "Featured Players" Section: Since you have no players, this section is counterproductive. Replace it with content that explains the benefits for players.

Create a "For Players" Benefits Section: Use icons and short text to highlight the value proposition:

✓ Create Your Profile for Free: No upfront cost to join.

✓ Reach a Global Audience: Connect with supporters from all over the world.

✓ Set Your Own Funding Goals: Raise money for travel, coaching, equipment, and more.

✓ We're Almost Ready: "Sign up now to be one of our first featured players at launch!"

Change the Primary Button: The most prominent button on the page should no longer be for sponsoring.

New Button Text: "Create Your Player Profile" or "Apply to Join"

3. Create a Player Sign-Up / Application Form
When a player clicks "Create Your Player Profile," it should take them to a dedicated sign-up page or a well-designed form. This is your most important new feature.

The form should collect key information to build their future profile:

Full Name

Age & Country (with flag)

Current Ranking (UTR, ITF, WTA/ATP, or National)

A Short Bio: "Tell us your story."

Your Goals: "What are you raising funds for?" (e.g., travel to a specific tournament series, new equipment, coaching).

Link to a video of you playing (YouTube, Vimeo, etc.). This is crucial for vetting.

Email Address (for communication).

Crucial Step: After they submit the form, direct them to a "Thank You & What's Next" page. This page must manage their expectations.
